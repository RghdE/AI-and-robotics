# Week 1 task -Robot operating system installation and configuration-



1- Install your preferred Virtual Machine. In my case, I have already installed VirtualBox because it works better on MacOS.

2- Install Ubunto 18.04 if you want to work on ROS Melodic, becuase it's written in their webpage [ROS Melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu) that it workks better with it. 

3- to make sure that ROS is working perfectly, run this command $ roscore, and you're done!
