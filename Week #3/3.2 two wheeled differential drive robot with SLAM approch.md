##
## Steps:
1. Follow the instructions on [diff_drive_bot](https://github.com/devanshdhrafani/diff_drive_bot)

```
$ cd catkin_ws/src

$ git clone https://github.com/devanshdhrafani/diff_drive_bot.git (cloning the package to your source folder)

$ cd ..

$ catkin_make

$ sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-dwa-local-planner

$ sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-joy

$ roslaunch diff_drive_bot gazebo.launch (here I used turtlebot3_house because I need the genertaed map later, but you can change it)
```

```
$ roslaunch diff_drive_bot gmapping.launch (open RViz)
```

```
$ rosrun diff_drive_bot keyboard_teleop.py (you can repalce it with joy_teleop_launch.launch if you have a joystick)
```

- move around with the robot untill the map is created and the robot has recognized the environment and the obstacles to avoid

save the map:
```
$ rosrun map_server map_saver -f ~/my_map
```

you can continue with the [Autonomous Navigation step](https://github.com/devanshdhrafani/diff_drive_bot#autonomous-navigation) but for my task this was enough.




## Problems Faced:
- I tried lots of packages for ROS robots to work on SLAM, the main problem I faced was the authours' lack of explaining the steps and the needed requirements for each robot, or maybe the task was a little advanced for my knowledge.

- many packages were missing configuration files for the package/robot to work properly.

### [Dpoom](https://github.com/SeunghyunLim/Dpoom_gazebo#2-turtlebot3_world-by-robotis) 
1. the robot didn't move and also in RViz the Robot wasn't visible.

2. I faced a lot of erros when I was following the exact instructions.

### [CHAMP](https://github.com/chvmp/champ) 
1. At first the environment wasn't visible in RViz and the robot model was full of errors

2. Gazebo wasn't loading the project or the environment

3. After I fixed Gazebo problem, the environment opened in Gazebo. But in RViz, the problem stayed the same and the robot wasn't moving:

- Gazebo wasn't openning at all no matter how much I tried.

## Solution:

So, After all the problems and all the time consumed on running multiple packages which none of them opened when it was working perfectly with other users. 
I figured that there was something wrong with Gazebo, or maybe I ran a wrong command when installing some of the authers' packages. 
1. I searched to look if my version works well with ROS melodic, and it was. 
2. Then I went on their offical website to look for Gazebo installation tutorials, It wasnt openning when I ran `$ gazebo `  in the terminal. 
3. So, I searched for the errors that were on the screen. 
The error was this: 

`[Err] [REST.cc:205] Error in REST request`

And this is the solustion:

Home -> ctrl + h (you'll see the hidden files) -> .ignition -> open 'config.yaml' = change the server to: 
``` 
url: https://api.ignitionrobotics.org 
```

That was it! **most** of these errors and all the horror I faced were because of Gazebo.
