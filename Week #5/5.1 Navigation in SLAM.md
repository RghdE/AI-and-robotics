# Using SLAM map to launch the navigation
 
Following the previous [task](https://github.com/raghdutionn/AI-and-robotics/blob/main/Week%20%233/3.1%20Turtlebot3%20with%20SLAM%20approach.md) which was about saving the SLAM map after moving the Robot around in it, to collect the surrounding environment information..
this task is about launching the navigation using RViz and Gazebo together. 

Follow [these steps](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/nav_simulation/) and you'll be good to go!
